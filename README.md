# verdantwatch-monitoring
Decentralized environmental monitoring network on Cardano – VerdantWatch Catalyst Fund15 proposal

**VerdantWatch: Relentless Vigilance of Earth's resources.**

VerdantWatch deploys low-cost sensors that stream tamper-proof air quality, soil health, PFAS/PFOS, and biodiversity data directly to Cardano. Every reading is immutable, instantly queryable, and community-governable.

## 🌿 Project Catalyst Fund15 Proposal
[Link to your final proposal once submitted – leave placeholder for now]

## 🚀 Current Status
- Prototype sensor data ingestion → Cardano transaction
- Mock dashboard (live demo coming)
- Milestones & budget in `/docs`

## Quick Start (for reviewers & contributors)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/verdantwatch-monitoring.git
cd verdantwatch-monitoring
# run mock sensor script
python mock_sensor.py

## Tech Stack
- Blockchain: Cardano mainnet + custom transaction metadata
- Scaling: Hydra heads for instant, low-cost data streams
- Hardware (planned): ESP32 / Arduino + LoRa sensors (partnerships in progress)
- Backend: Python + Cardano serialization-lib
- Frontend: React dashboard (live mock in `/dashboard`)
- Data verification: On-chain timestamps + Merkle proofs

## Folder Structure
- `/code`      → sensor scripts, Cardano integration, mock data generator
- `/dashboard` → live React mock UI (deployed via GitHub Pages)
- `/docs`       → full Catalyst proposal PDF, detailed budget, milestones, risk analysis
- `/data`       → sample datasets & example queries

## Get Involved
We’re actively seeking:
- Sensor hardware partners (PFAS, air quality, soil)
- Cardano developers for Hydra & smart-contract governance layer
- Environmental Gov and NGOs for pilot deployments
- Impact investors & Catalyst voters
