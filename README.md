# verdantwatch-monitoring
Decentralized environmental monitoring network on Cardano – VerdantWatch Catalyst Fund15 proposal

**VerdantWatch: Relentless Vigilance of Earth's resources.**

VerdantWatch deploys low-cost sensors that stream tamper-proof air quality, soil health, PFAS/PFOS, and biodiversity data directly to Cardano. Every reading is immutable, instantly queryable, and community-governable.
